The past 12 years have seen Gabel rise from acoustic folk-punk gunslinger in the dives of Gainesville, Florida to releasing Against Me!'s four searing, blood-smeared slices of scrappy punk. The last of which, 2007's New Wave, was the major label debut, one that Spin magazine anointed as their Album Of The Year. And while Gainesville was home, Gabel felt the walls closing in when touring for New Wave came to an end. So he split. With his wife, he left behind the "didja-hear-about-so-and-so" insular Gainesville world for the sleepy beach town of St. Augustine, wandering the streets and driving dusty back roads: searching, pining, hoping for inspiration. He found it in spades. The result is White Crosses, as powerful and as bold a rock record as one can imagine. The band ­- Gabel, guitarist James Bowman, bassist Andrew Seward and new drummer George Rebelo - roar like fighter jets screaming over a stadium on the anthemic title-track (with its shout along line about smashing the 4,000 crosses on a local church's lawn, ones that signify the number of babies aborted each day in the U.S.). Joining that is the escapist fury of "Spanish Moss," and the short stick of dynamite, "Rapid Decompression." New Wave eschewed some of the roughness of the band's earlier efforts, but White Crosses goes even further in filling out the band's wallop. With its twinkling piano and a glorious whoa-oa chorus, "Because Of The Shame" could be an outtake from Bruce Springsteen's classic Born To Run. "Ache With Me" is a slow-jam that would make Paul Westerberg blush, while "High Pressure Low" is Billy Idol meets fellow Gainesville native Tom Petty. "This is my Florida record," says Gabel. ""I spent a lot of time writing this record while driving directionless on forgotten Florida state roads, highly caffeinated, with albums like [Petty's] Full Moon Fever blasting on my stereo."</p>

It's available on DVD! How does a little show called NBC's Last Comic Standing grab you? Fact: he finished top six in the 2007 season, no big deal. Doug was a series regular on four seasons of VH-1's Best Week Ever. He makes recurring appearances on ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live. His second Comedy Central Presents half-hour special premiered in January '09. He had the nerve to hit on Jennifer Aniston on the classic sitcom Friends, is a character on The Sarah Silverman Program, and oops, almost forgot, got Larry David in a headlock on HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm. If that's not enough for you, he's a creator/writer/star of The Marijuana-Logues, a show that's been a hit (small pun intended) in clubs and theatres from Los Angeles to New York - and drew a bongload of rave reviews. Now there's a CD, also called The Marijuana-Logues, and a book, The Marijuana-Logues: Everything About Pot That We Could Remember. In 2006, High Times Magazine named him Stoner of the Year, and in 2009, he successfully made it to all the shows in his thirteen-day Medical Marijuana Tour. Now Doug has two CD's out on Comedy Central Records, Unbalanced Load and Hypocritical Oaf, which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Comedy Chart. He continues to express his love of movies on his Doug Loves Movies podcasts (available on iTunes). And now Doug's long-running live show, The Benson Interruption is a series broadcast on Comedy Central.

<div class="incoming_body"><b>Event Info:</b><br><p>Glory Days &amp; High Tides present:<br><br><strong>ZACH DEPUTY</strong><br>with Janna Pelle &amp; The Half Steps<br><br><a href="http://www.zachdeputy.com/">www.zachdeputy.com</a> <br><br>There is nothing out there like Zach Deputy. Truly a one-man band, he is a powerhouse of performance, technical chops, and one hell of a charismatic presence. Put simply, Zach Deputy does what is called live looping: layering sounds through the magic of technology to create a full band effect. He isn't the only performer out there doing this, but he has taken the technique to the next level. First and foremost, however, Zach Deputy is a songwriter, a shredding guitarist and a soulful singer with a 4+ octave vocal range.<br><br>He can also drop freestyle rhymes with the best of them. The Zach Deputy sound is essentially roots rock, but in his case the roots are in soul, calypso and dancehall, underpinned by driving hip-hop, rock steady, Motown and Stax backbeats created with his layered vocal beatboxing. On top of the backbeat, Zach Deputy's nylon strings pull multiple duties as bass, rhythm and lead guitar. Riding over that, a plethora of sounds- keyboard, steel drums and an entire horn section- come pumping and grinding out of the speakers when Zach takes the stage. He is a one man dance party, but he can also bring an audience to rapt attention with a heartfelt love ballad.<br><br>Hailing from the South Carolina coast, Zach Deputy's family roots are in Puerto Rico and St. Croix. Cruzan rhythms and folk songs competed with blues and American roots music for space on the family stereo. Having toured the country in his late teens and early 20's with a couple of bands that just didn't inspire him, Zach Deputy followed his muse back to the Atlantic coast, where he began to craft his own approach to music as a solo artist. Zach embraced the creative freedom of performing alone, but soon realized it also had its limitations. Thus, he began to employ live looping as a means of filling out the sound. Zach Deputy is now a full band unto himself, made possible through simple technology, but delivered by a skill and mastery of technique, made pure through the injection of warm, charming soul.<br><br>From his base in Hilton Head, Zach Deputy has been performing 250-300 shows a year for the last four years, and has expanded his base into the Northeast and Midwest over the last 12 months. The pace of growth has been startling. Tourists and summer residents of the South Carolina and Georgia beachside resort communities got caught up in the fun took the music back home, creating fan bases in places where Zach Deputy had yet to travel, leading to remarkable first time attendance numbers in many new markets. Promoters and regional acts, blown away by the refreshing new sound, have also enthusiastically made it their mission to help Zach build his fanbase.<br><br>Zach Deputy now basically lives and works from a small box truck, playing almost every night of the week. The tireless work ethic is paying off, as audiences all up-and-down the East Coast and as far West as the Mississippi are reacting with genuine joy and passion, spreading the word to friends and fellow music lovers. Zach Deputy is bound to hit your town soon. If he does, head on over-he will be glad to see you-but be sure to bring your dancing shoes... and prepare for the wow factor.</p><br>$10 Advance<br>$12 Day Of<br>Doors open at 9:00<br><br>Tickets available without service charges at Common Grounds, High Tides, Hear Again Music

Rex.

<div class="incoming_body"><b>Event Info:</b><br>Common Grounds presents<br><br><strong>THAT ONE GUY<br></strong>with guests TBA<br><br>$10 / Doors open at 8:00 <div><br></div><div><div>PLEASE!!!! You have to watch this:</div><div>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpc325WEsNB&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>www.thatoneguy.com</div><div><br></div><div>“Funky Bean,” “Buttmachine,” Mustaches and Laser beams. It reads like a page out of a Dr. Seuss book, but for Mike Silverman, better known as That 1 Guy, it is just the reality he was searching for.</div><div><br></div><div>At 150-200 live shows each year people gather to see his mad scientist at work, curiously watching as That 1 Guy plugs an electric chord into the heel of a cowboy boot and transforms it into an instrument. He howls and the audience joins him like a pack of coyotes. They even chime in for the song “Weasel Pot Pie,” offering rhymes to finish a line about “cinnamon scones”: Twilight Zones? Al Capones? Frank Stallones? That 1 Guy laughs and offers the grin of a Cheshire cat. Here is a man who loves his job.</div><div><br></div><div>Silverman’s back story is not dissimilar to other musicians: he grew up a music geek, influenced by his jazz musician father, and enrolled in San Francisco Conservatory of Music before joining the jazz scene himself as a sought-after percussive bassist. This is where the similarities end, though, and where That 1 Guy began. “In my case, being a bass player, I just felt very restricted by the instrument itself,” he says. “I’ve always wanted to sound different and have my own sound. I was headed that way on the bass, but for me to fully realize what I was hearing in my head sonically I was going to have to do it my way."</div><div><br></div><div>That 1 Guy set off on his own, challenging the idea of what a one-man band can and should be. Rather than altering and adding on to the bass, he started from scratch, conceptualizing and creating the Magic Pipe. Standing at seven-feet-tall, the collection of swiveling pipes, metal gears, bass strings and electronic buttons forms the shape of a harp, but is played like a futuristic gutbucket.</div><div><br></div><div>With his curious instrument, creative performances and abundant talent, That 1 Guy soon caught the attention of promoters around the world and began touring heavily, wowing crowds at Big Day Out, Glastonbury, Monterrey Jazz Festival, Lowlands, Wakarusa and numerous other festivals. In 2007 he joined Guns ‘N’ Roses guitarist Buckethead on an American tour before headlining his own “Mustaches and Laser Beams” tour through North America.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite a demanding tour schedule, That 1 Guy has no plans on slowing down in 2010. His latest album PACKS A WALLOP! brings a new dimension to his work, thanks to new sounds and a new partnership with famed sound engineer Billy Hume (Nelly, Shop Boyz, Ying Yang Twins). Recorded at Hume’s studio in Atlanta, GA, PACKS A WALLOP! stretches That 1 Guy’s soundscapes further than ever, seamlessly combining hard-hitting rock (“Modern Man”), swampy blues (“Step Into Striped Light”) and electronic groove (“Funk Bean”). Hume’s influence brings greater depth to the low frequencies and heavy beats. “I’m really proud of what we did with the album,” says That 1 Guy. “It sounds closer to what I’ve been trying to do sonically since I started.”</div><div><br></div><div>This accomplishment required a new creative process. Whereas his last two albums, The Moon is Disgusting (2006) and Songs in the Key of Beotch (2000, re-released in 2004) were created from songs that he had already performed, That 1 Guy went into The Zone with nothing but ideas, sleeping on a mattress upstairs so he could sneak in to the studio whenever he felt inspired. “I went in there with zero – nothing finished – and I lived at the studio for a month. It was really hard work, really long days, and I forced myself to craft some stuff.” The spontaneity, coupled with a tight window for completing the album, made all the difference.</div><div><br></div><div>“Human beings do our best work when we’re challenged and pushed up against the wall,” That 1 Guy explains. “By nature, we’re hunters and gathers, spending each day looking for next meal. It’s easy to be lazy when you don’t have to come up with something creative right away.”</div><div><br></div><div>His creativity continues with a new tour in support of PACKS A WALLOP! Along with the Magic Pipe, expect to see the Magic Saw and Magic Flute, as well as magic tricks. “I had never seen a magic show until about two years ago,” That 1 Guy confesses. “I had no interest in it—but now I just love it. I’m like a twelve-year-old,” incorporating magic tricks seamlessly into live performances, even using a playing card in place of a traditional pick. “So much of my music has miraculous qualities to it because it’s hard to tell what’s going on. There are lots of slights of hand and sonic misdirection. It feels like I was meant to do magic.”</div><div><br></div><div>Strange? Perhaps. But as Billboard noted, “In the case of Mike Silverman’s slamming, futuristic funk act… the normal rules of biology just don’t apply.” It suits That 1 Guy just fine.</div><div><br></div><div>“I like being my own person,” he says. “I didn’t set out to be a weirdo but I’m starting to embrace it.” - thatoneguy.com&nbsp;</div></div>

On Stage:<br><strong>JONATHAN RICHMAN<br></strong>featuring Tommy Larkins<br>on the Drums<br><br>$12 / Doors open at 7:00<br><br><a href="http://www.vaporrecords.com/">www.vaporrecords.com</a> <br><br>Jonathan Richman&nbsp;is one of rock's most eccentric and unpredictable cult figures, a performer whose eternally childlike public persona and seeming naiveté -- typified by songs like "Ice Cream Man," "Hey There Little Insect" and "I'm a Little Aeroplane" -- tended to obscure the dexterity and craft of his music, which skirted from garage rock to country to Latin stylings and back. Born May 15, 1951 in Boston, Massachusetts, Richman began playing guitar at the age of 15, and within a year was making his first public appearances. In 1969 he relocated to New York, the home of the Velvet Underground (his central musical influence), and spent his first two weeks in the city sleeping on the Velvets' manager's couch.</p><p>While working a series of odd jobs, including a tenure as a foot messenger for Esquire magazine, Richman attempted to find a venue to perform his music, but his simple songs and adenoidal voice were roundly rejected; he ultimately moved back to Boston in 1970, where he formed the first incarnation of the influential proto-punk band the Modern Lovers with guitarist John Felice, drummer David Robinson and bassist Rolfe Anderson. Within a few months, Anderson had been replaced by Ernie Brooks, and keyboardist Jerry Harrison stepped in for Felice. After recording some demos with Kim Fowley in the spring of 1971 (unissued until 1981), in 1973, the Modern Lovers (with producer John Cale) recorded the demos which comprised their seminal self-titled debut, featuring long-standing Richman favorites like "Roadrunner," "Pablo Picasso" and "Hospital." Problems with their label, however, blocked the songs' release until 1976; at the same time, Richman wanted to quiet the group's minimalist, garagey sound, leading to their breakup in 1973.</p><p>Eventually, Richman formed a new, acoustic Modern Lovers with guitarist Leroy Radcliffe, Rubinoos bassist Greg "Curly" Keranen and drummer Robinson. In 1977, they debuted with Jonathan Richman &amp; the Modern Lovers, which emphasized the doo-wop flavor and wry pop melodies that remained hallmarks of Richman's career. That same year, the group issued Rock 'N' Roll With the Modern Lovers (with D. Sharpe on drums) and scored a major European hit with the instrumental "Egyptian Reggae." A year later, Richman went solo, and in 1979 issued Back in Your Life.</p><p>After a period of self-imposed exile, he resurfaced in 1983 with Jonathan Sings A series of strong pop records followed, including 1985's Rockin' &amp; Romance, 1986's It's Time for Jonathan Richman &amp; the Modern Lovers (recorded with Andy Paley), and Modern Lovers 88. In 1990, he released the self-explanatory Jonathan Goes Country; later, he made another left turn with 1993's Jonathan, Te Vas a Emocionar!, a collection of Latin-influenced songs performed entirely in Spanish. No matter what path his music took, however, Richman's cult following remained fiercely loyal, and saw its ranks expand courtesy of his frequent appearances on the NBC program Late Night With Conan O'Brien; in 1998, he was also prominently featured in the hit film comedy There's Something About Mary. - allmusic.com </p>
