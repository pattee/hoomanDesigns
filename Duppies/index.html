                <p>February 16, 2015</p>
                <p>We just played the most picturesque wedding in South Florida. Congratulations Danny and Ali Portilla! Talking about South Florida, great times were had. The reggae culture is as strong as ever. We are overjoyed to witness Ska fans enjoy themselves with such ferver. Get hyped, because we have just finished confirming our Southeastern tour out to Texas in April. I'm sure we will let you all know specifics closer to the tour. Hiebel is considering calling it the "Don't Mess with Texas" tour. Our final mixes of most of our new record are done-zo! I'd tell you more about it, but I don't want to be a tease. Big ups to all you Duppies fans and stay tuned folks!</p>
