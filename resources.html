    <h1>Resources for New and Intermediate Web Developers</h1>
    <p>This page serves as a repository for new to intermediate level Web Developers. It has tips, resources, and information that I've found useful along the way. It also just serves as a resource for myself. As in...where did I put that link?! Oh..now it's easy to find!</p>

            <h3><li>MOOCs</li></h3>
                <p>In case you missed it (and I think many people have) there's been a large movement toward making information and knowledge free. Many top level universities are doing what's called MOOC's for free. That stands for Massive Open Online Course. Here's some of the resources I've found:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://academicearth.org/">Academic Earth</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://oedb.org/open/">Open Education Database</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.open2study.com/">Open 2 Study</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.openculture.com/">Open Culture</a></li>
                </ul> 
            <h3><li><a href="http://www.lynda.com/?co=2" target="_blank">Lynda</a></li></h3>
            <p>Not a free resource, but by far...the best resource in terms of the amount you can learn here. Anything web design, coding, business, photography, graphic design, product design, video editing, animation...Am I forgetting things? yes. Because there's so much to learn you just won't make it to the end. And if you do? Stop paying, it's a month by month subscription, so commitment isn't required.</p>
            
            <h3><li>Privacy and Browsing</li></h3>
            <p><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">Duck Duck Go</a> is a great private search engine. Doesn't keep any of your personal information at all. None of this non-sense about trying to personalize your user experience either. It just gives you the internet, straight up. It also has an awesome user experience of giving you a human type answer at the top of the search results. So, say you search for 'tangent', a useful definition will pop up at the top of the search results and not just a list of resources that you then have to click in order to know the answer.</p>
            <p>Also there's <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/goodies">Duck Duck Go Goodies</a>. It's a list of useful small programs that are created by users and that everyone can participate in.</p>

            <h3><li><a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a></li></h3>
            <p>As a developer, you'll want to get Firebug from Mozilla if you don't already have it. It helps you de-construct web pages as well as modify any web page on the go, in the browser. Or you could even add more by adding the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/" target="_blank">Web Developer</a> package of goodies, also a Firefox extension and written by <a href="http://chrispederick.com/" target="_blank">Chris Pederick</a>. It goes much further than Firebug and allows you to do all kinds of nifty things.</p>
            
            <h3><li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">WW3 Schools</a></li></h3>
            <p>This is great for a basic starter resource for HTML/CSS, Javascript, amoung other things. I often use it as a resource when I draw a blank on how to do basic stuff I haven't done in a while.</p>
            
            <h3><li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">CodeAcademy</a></li></h3>
            <p>I love this site. It teaches you to code by example. Which is great for me because it allows me to practice and explains soo much in a basic way that anyone can understand. Last time I checked into it, it teaches HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, Python, and Ruby.</p>

            <p>This includes the 'Way Back Machine'. That keeps snapshots of the history of the web universe going back into history. Cool, huh? Also a great amount of free resources, including music archives and books.</p>
