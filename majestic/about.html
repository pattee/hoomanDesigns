                <h2>A story based in design.</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>We've been design people for longer than we can remember. Design comes about because you need to use things and you want to use them with ease. We believe design is more than just how things look. It's how things function. It's how easy it is to use. When things are designed well then you don't notice the design. You just feel relieved that a product is easy to use.</p>
                <p>So when we started creating web sites making them with design. We design websites for users to have a pleasant interaction. We design them to be informational and functional. We design with the consumer in mind. Then we create with code using clean and organized code.</p>
                <p>Why does this matter? It matters because when you build things right it's a lot easier for someone else to come in and update things. So whether you stay with us or not you'll have a product that portable. That's also compliant with disability standards. That also takes marketing concepts into account.</p>
